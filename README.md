# Dice-Game
In this simple two-player dice game, each player rolls a six-sided die simultaneously. The player with the higher roll wins the round, while a tie occurs if both roll the same number. The game, which can be played in single or multiple rounds to keep score, is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive web experience.
